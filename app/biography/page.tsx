      <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
        Hachalu Hundessa was a famous Oromo singer, songwriter, and activist. He
        was widely known for his music that focused on the struggles, identity,
        and rights of the Oromo people, Ethiopia&apos;s largest ethnic group.
        His songs became anthems for political and social movements in Ethiopia.
        Tragically, he was assassinated in June 2020, which sparked widespread
        protests and unrest in Ethiopia. His legacy lives on through his
        powerful music and the impact he had on Oromo culture and Ethiopian
        society.
